"""Makes the volatile PowerPC registers C++ locals of every generated function, written back to ctx only where
something else can see them.

  python tools/volatile_locals.py [--gen app/generated/default_mp] [--list FILE] [--no-trim] [--scalars-only] [--check]

The code generator keeps r0-r13, f0-f13 and the vector registers v0-v13, v32-v63 in the PPCContext struct (ctx);
the non-volatile ones are already locals (non_volatile_as_local in app/overrides.toml). GCC cannot keep a ctx field
in a host register across a guest load or store: guest memory is reached through may_alias pointers
(app/src/bo2zm_guest_memory.h) or volatile ones, which may point anywhere, ctx included (ctx is __restrict, but it is
handed to every callee; a __restrict base as well changed nothing: 0.4 % fewer instructions in one file). So every
write of such a register is a store to ctx, and every read after a guest store reloads it: in the hot loop of
sub_824D74D0, 7 of ~28 instructions per pass were stores to ctx of registers that the next pass overwrote.

For each function this tool:
  - declares a local for every volatile register the function uses (initialized from ctx at entry when its
    value there may be read);
  - replaces ctx.rN / ctx.fN / ctx.vN with the local everywhere else;
  - before every point where other code can read ctx (a call to a game function, an import, a native routine or an
    indirect call; ppc_trap; the setjmp copy `env = ctx`; every return and the end of the function) writes back the
    locals that may differ from ctx there (a forward data-flow pass over the function's statements, labels, gotos and
    blocks: a local differs from ctx once written, until it is written back or reloaded);
  - after every point where other code can change ctx (the same calls, and a longjmp landing at a setjmp site)
    reloads from ctx the locals that may be read afterwards (a backward pass, the write-backs counting as reads).
A call followed by a return (a tail call) writes back everything that differs and is not reloaded.

Calls to game functions are trimmed with a summary of each callee (unless --no-trim): IN, the volatile registers it
may read before writing them (through its own callees too; a write of part of a register counts as a read), and OUT,
those it may write. A call writes back only the differing locals in IN | OUT and reloads only OUT; a local outside
both keeps its value, still marked as differing, since the callee neither reads nor changes it in ctx. Anything that
is not a direct call to a game function with a body here (hooks, imports, native routines, indirect calls) counts as
reading and writing every register. So at every point where another function can look at a register in ctx, it holds
the value the original code would have left there.

Vector registers (on by default, --scalars-only leaves them in ctx): their array members are handed to the SIMD
helpers by pointer and some are indexed by a variable (the unaligned vector stores), so GCC keeps a vector local in
memory (on the stack) instead of a register. In bo2zm_recomp.10.cpp they took sub_824D74D0's stores to ctx from 1,105
to 132 but put 853 loads and stores on the stack (95 before): the function came out at 6,407 instructions against
6,110 with --scalars-only and 6,553 as generated.

Status: a measured experiment, not a step of tools/codegen.sh. The scalar form (--scalars-only --no-trim) cut the
stores of bo2zm_recomp.10.cpp by 8.7 % and its hot loop from ~28 to ~20 instructions a pass, and .text by 3.3 %, yet
three alternating pairs of runs on an OLED showed no change in frame rate or in any thread's CPU per frame.

Functions left as they are: those in app/locals.txt (tools/localize.py makes checked copies of them from the original
form), those that reach ctx registers they do not own (the SEH funclets and pieces of split functions that share their
owner's registers: a non-volatile, CR, CTR or XER register in ctx with no local of the same name), and, with --list,
every function not on the list. The summaries are made from the original form, so the tool runs on freshly generated
code (tools/codegen.sh); a function already rewritten carries MARK and is skipped.

--check changes nothing and exits 1 if a function that should be rewritten is not (for a build script, if the step is
ever made part of tools/codegen.sh).
