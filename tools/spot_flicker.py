"""Finds what blinks in a test spot's burst of screenshots (bo2zm_test_spot, app/src/bo2zm_benchmark.cpp).

The test stands the player still with no zombies, so in a correct image almost nothing changes from one screenshot to
the next. This compares the burst pixel by pixel:
  - changed: the pixel's colour moved by more than --threshold (0-255, any channel) at least once;
  - blinking: it moved that much in two or more separate steps (it went one way and came back, or kept jumping),
    which is what a flickering light or a surface that drops in and out does, unlike a slow fade.
It prints the share of each, the frames that differ most from the others (a whole-image flash), and the screen areas
(a grid of 40x40 cells on 1280x720) with the most blinking pixels; --out writes the first screenshot, darkened, with
blinking pixels red and changed ones yellow.

The HUD (points, the round, the ammo, the compass) can change on its own: read those areas with that in mind.
The screenshots and the picture come from the game: keep them out of the repo.
