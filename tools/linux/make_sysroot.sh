#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds the AArch64 Linux sysroot that app/build_linux.sh compiles and links against.
#
#   tools/linux/make_sysroot.sh [<output folder>]     (default: out/linux-sysroot, under the checkout)
#
# The sysroot is a plain folder of Ubuntu 24.04 (noble) arm64 packages: glibc, libstdc++ 14 and the development
# headers SDL needs for X11, Wayland, ALSA, PulseAudio and PipeWire. Packages are only unpacked (mmdebstrap's extract
# variant), so no ARM code runs and no emulator is needed to make it.
#
# Reproducibility: only noble's release pocket is used, never noble-updates or noble-security. The release pocket has
# not changed since Ubuntu 24.04 shipped, so every run picks the same package versions. The list of what went in is
# written to <output>/packages.txt; tools/linux/sysroot-packages.txt is the list a known-good build used, and the
# script warns if the two differ.
#
# The game itself links glibc dynamically (so the player's own system libraries, Vulkan driver and audio server are
# used) and libstdc++ statically. The binary therefore needs glibc 2.38 or newer: Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13, Fedora 39,
# Raspberry Pi OS (Debian 13 based) and newer.
#
# For the QEMU smoke test (tools/linux/smoke_qemu.sh) the sysroot also carries the runtime side: the Vulkan loader
# and Mesa's software driver (lavapipe). The build itself never uses them.
#
# Needs: mmdebstrap (apt install mmdebstrap) and network access to ports.ubuntu.com. Run as root (Docker, WSL) or
# with unprivileged user namespaces (mmdebstrap picks the mode).
