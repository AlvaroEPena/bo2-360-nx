# Starts the Linux ARM64 build on an x86_64 Linux machine under QEMU user-mode emulation, with Mesa's software Vulkan
# driver (lavapipe) from the sysroot and a virtual X server, to check that it runs as far as it can without ARM
# hardware: it starts, reads its config, opens the game files and creates its Vulkan device. Emulation is far too slow
# to play; the run stops after a time limit. With QEMU 10 (Debian 13's static build) it reaches the Zombies main menu in
# about a minute. Ubuntu 24.04's QEMU 8.2 crashes on its own after a while ("QEMU internal SIGSEGV"), at a different
# point each run: that is the emulator, not the game; set BO2_QEMU to a newer qemu-aarch64.
