#   refs/              a junction to the main checkout's refs (read-only use).
#   sdk/thirdparty/*   junctions to the main checkout's fetched third-party sources (tools/fetch_thirdparty.py). The
#                      few tracked files in sdk/thirdparty stay this worktree's own.
#   app/generated/     a junction to the main checkout's generated C++ (read-only). With --own-generated, a copy, for
#                      work that runs the code generator.
#   work/              a junction (the decrypted image, read-only).
# BO2_BUILD_TAG makes the builds use app/out/{win,switch}-<tag> with their own copy of the SDK's libraries, so two
# checkouts never write the same file. The PC run needs the shader library next to the exe: it is hard-linked from
# the main checkout's app/out/win. Game data stays on E: (read-only), as in the main checkout.
