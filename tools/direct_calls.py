"""Direct calls between game functions that have no hook.

DEFINE_REX_FUNC (app/generated/default_mp/bo2zm_pch.h) makes every recompiled function sub_X a *weak* alias of
__imp__sub_X, so a hook (REX_HOOK_RAW(sub_X) in app/src) can replace it at link time. The codegen always calls sub_X,
and a compiler never inlines a call through a weak alias (a hook might replace it), in the same file or with LTO. This
tool rewrites `sub_X(ctx, base);` into `__imp__sub_X(ctx, base);` in bo2zm_recomp.*.cpp when sub_X has no hook: the
same function, but now one the compiler may inline. bo2zm_init.cpp and bo2zm_register.cpp are not touched, so indirect
calls (function pointers, vtables, the dispatch table) still go through sub_X and still reach every hook.

A function counts as hooked if its address (82xxxxxx) appears in the code of app/src, app/CMakeLists.txt or the SDK
(sdk/src, include): hooks are sometimes built from pieces (REX_HOOK_RAW(sub_##a) in bo2zm_d3d_trace.cpp,
with the addresses in bo2zm_d3d_trace_list.inc), so looking for REX_HOOK_RAW(sub_...) is not enough. Comments (after
//) and lines marked "call only" (functions the port calls through the dispatch table, app/src/bo2zm_guest.h) do not
count. That still over-counts a little (data addresses), which only costs some direct calls. --objects checks the other direction: every
strong sub_ symbol the compiled app objects define must be on the list.

The rewrite goes both ways and is idempotent: hooked -> sub_X, not hooked -> __imp__sub_X. Run it after every codegen
(tools/codegen.sh does) and whenever a hook is added or removed; the build scripts run --check, which fails when a
hooked function is called directly (its hook would only see indirect calls).
