// The home screen's credits line: "Ported by: AlvaroEPena" with GitHub's mark beside it (app/src/ui/credits, drawn by
// tools/make_credits.py), in the bottom-right corner of the Zombies home menu, on the row of its button prompts.
//
// It is this port's own layer, not part of the game's UI: the native renderer draws it over the finished image in
// its output pass (bo2zm_native_targets.cpp), like the FPS counter, from images that go into the program as bytes.
// The game's menus never know about it, so nothing of the game's is changed or added. The menu Lua (menus.lua) says
// when the home menu is up with nothing over it, and only then is it drawn: a popup (Extras, CHECK FOR UPDATES), any
// other menu and a match hide it.
//
// Each screen size gets an image drawn at one pixel per pixel: 720 lines (handheld) and 1080 (docked) have their own,
// so the text stays sharp; other sizes (a PC window) take the nearer one.
