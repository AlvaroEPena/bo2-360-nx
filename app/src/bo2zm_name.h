// The player's name: EDIT USERNAME in Extras (the home menu only, app/src/ui/menus.lua). The game takes the console
// profile's name as the gamertag (XamUserGetName, XamUserGetSigninInfo) and shows it in lobbies and matches; the SDK
// names the profile "User". The port keeps the player's pick as user_name in bo2zm_settings.txt and gives it to the
// profile at start-up, before the game signs in. Editing opens the SDK's text input (rex/kernel/xam/text_input.h: a
// text box on PC, the console's keyboard on Switch); the new name counts from the next lobby or match. A rename keeps
// the same profile: its folder (the game's profile settings) is named by the profile's XUID, not by its name
// (ContentManager::ResolveGameUserContentPath).
