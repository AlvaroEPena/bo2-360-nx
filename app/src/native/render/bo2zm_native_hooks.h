// What the command ring does not say about each draw, taken on the game thread instead.
//
// The vertex shader microcode reaches the ring already patched by D3D: fetches reordered, swizzles taken from the
// vertex declaration, and outputs the pixel shader does not read nulled out. Looking it up in the shader library by
// its contents is therefore not reliable. The exact identity is known on the game thread:
//   - The shader constructors (sub_8259BC90 PS, sub_8259C038 VS) receive the original container and
//     return the object: object -> container.
//   - Each D3D Draw* reads the bound VS and PS from the device and leaves a record in a queue. The ring
//     sink pairs each draw with its record, in the same order, checking primitive type and count.
