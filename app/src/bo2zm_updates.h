// CHECK FOR UPDATES on the home screen (app/src/ui/menus.lua), in builds for development consoles: it asks the PC that
// serves their builds what it stages for this console and compares that with the files here, without downloading
// anything (no update server set up, no server answered, up to date, or an update with its build and size). The
// download itself runs at the next start of the game, before the game exists, because the running game keeps files
// open that an update replaces. Standard builds have no update server: the menus leave the button out and these
// functions do nothing (bo2zm_lifecycle.cpp).
