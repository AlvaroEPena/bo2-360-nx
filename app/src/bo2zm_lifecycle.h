// Start-up and shutdown hooks that the app calls at fixed points of a run (bo2zm_app.h, bo2zm_benchmark.cpp).

// A build for development consoles fills them with its PC link (log uploads, new builds, the benchmark watchdog). The
// standard build compiles bo2zm_lifecycle.cpp instead, which keeps only what every console needs: the console stays
// awake through a benchmark, and the first constructor hands over to the campaign program when a launch for it is
// pending (bo2zm_relaunch.h, HandOverEarly).
